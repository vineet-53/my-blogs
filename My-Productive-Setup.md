# My Productive Setup: Neovim, Tmux, and More

--- 

As a developer, efficiency and customization are key to building a productive workflow. Over the past year and a half, I’ve refined my setup by switching from VSCode to Neovim, adding powerful tools like Tmux and LazyGit, and adopting a dynamic window manager. Here’s a breakdown of my current workflow and how it’s made me a more efficient developer.

## The Switch to Neovim
About a year and a half ago, I transitioned from using VSCode to Vim, and soon after, to **Neovim**. The reason was simple: efficiency. Neovim keeps my hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse, allowing me to stay focused while coding. While it’s possible to use Vim keybindings in VSCode, Neovim offers a deeper, more immersive experience with endless customization possibilities. Plus, it’s lightweight and fast, making it ideal for developers who like to optimize their environment.

## Key Plugins in My Setup
Neovim’s true power lies in its plugins. Here are some that have made a huge difference in my workflow:

- **Telescope**: Quick and efficient file search, helping me navigate projects in seconds.
- **LazyGit**: Managing Git from within Neovim has never been easier.
- **LSP (Language Server Protocol)**: With built-in formatting and code completion, LSP makes my coding process smoother.
- **Obsidian-Nvim**: This one’s my favorite. It integrates my Obsidian vault directly into Neovim, making note-taking and idea management seamless.

## Tmux: A Game-Changer for Session Management
Before using **Tmux**, I constantly had to reopen projects, which became frustrating over time. Now, Tmux allows me to create multiple sessions, and I can easily switch between them without losing my place. Its **pane management feature** is also a game-changer—it’s perfect for organizing multiple tasks and files in one terminal. If you’re serious about productivity, Tmux is worth a try.

## LazyGit: Simplifying Git Workflow
Though **LazyGit** integrates with Neovim, I’ve also installed it on **Arch Linux** to streamline my Git operations. It’s intuitive and makes managing branches, commits, and pull requests much faster and easier. For anyone dealing with Git regularly, this is a must-have tool.

## Hyprland: Dynamic Tiling Window Manager
I can’t say enough good things about **Hyprland**. Its dynamic tiling and smooth animations make window navigation a breeze. I used to struggle with organizing my workspaces, but Hyprland has allowed me to create a more organized and visually appealing workspace. It’s perfect for developers looking to optimize window management.

## Zsh: Enhancing My Terminal Experience
Finally, **Zsh** is my terminal of choice, and with a customized `.zshrc`, it enhances every aspect of my workflow. The flexibility and speed of Zsh, combined with Tmux and Neovim, complete my setup. For anyone interested, my `.dotfiles` are available on GitHub.

## Wrapping It Up
My productive setup has been a journey of trial and error, but it’s transformed how I work. I’ve drawn inspiration from channels like **The Primeagen**, **TJ Devries**, and countless Neovim and Obsidian videos on YouTube. If you’re looking to optimize your own workflow, I highly recommend checking them out and experimenting with your tools.
